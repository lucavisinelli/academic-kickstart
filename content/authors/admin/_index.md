I am an Assistant Professor of physics at [Università degli Studi di Salerno](https://corsi.unisa.it/fisica/home) (Italy) since March 2025. I previously held a tenure-track fellowship at the [Tsung-Dao Lee Institute](https://tdli.sjtu.edu.cn/EN/) (China), was a ["Fellini" Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellow](https://web.infn.it/fellini/) at the [National Institute of Nuclear Physics (INFN)](http://w3.lnf.infn.it/?lang=en) (Italy), a Fellow at the [Gravitation, AstroParticle Physics Amsterdam (GRAPPA)](https://grappa.amsterdam) (Netherlands), and a postdoctoral researcher at [NORDITA](https://www.nordita.org) in Stockholm (Sweden). I graduated from The University of Utah in Salt Lake City, UT (USA).

My research spans various topics in particle astrophysics, dark matter, dark energy, and black holes. I have focused particularly on the axion as a dark matter candidate, for which I co-wrote a [review on Physics Report](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0370157320302477?via%3Dihub) in 2020. I also collaborated on an influential [paper on the Hubble tension](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6382/ac086d) in 2021.

In 2023, I was awarded a [Research Fund For International Scientists](https://www.nsfc.gov.cn/english/site_1/international/D5/2021/04-02/231.html) grant by the National Science Foundation of China for the project "Astrophysical Axion Laboratories". In 2022, I was co-recipient of the prestigious [Buchalter Cosmology Prize](http://www.buchaltercosmologyprize.org) for "opening new, unforeseen vistas for the scientific scope of direct detection dark matter experiments".

My h-index is 46 according to [Inspire-HEP](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1269953), and my [Erdös number](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/collaborationDistance.html) is 4.
