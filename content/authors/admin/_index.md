I am a ["Fellini" Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellow](https://web.infn.it/fellini/) at the [National Institute of Nuclear Physics (INFN)](http://w3.lnf.infn.it/?lang=en) in Frascati (Italy). I was previously a post-doctoral fellow at the Gravitation, AstroParticles Physics Amsterdam (GRAPPA), a postdoc at NORDITA, Stockholm University, Uppsala University, and a graduate student at The University of Utah in Salt Lake City, UT (USA).

My research activity spans various interesting topics including particle astrophysics, dark matter, dark energy, and black holes. I have focused in exploring the role the axion as a dark matter candidate, for which I co-wrote a [review on Physics Report](https://www.sciencedirect.com/user/identity/landing?code=4V2hffr9561gPl_VXcou7D98hc85Zq6NI9Ai7DLP&state=retryCounter%3D0%26csrfToken%3Dc6c720d7-9376-460b-b798-f378521f7d25%26idpPolicy%3Durn%253Acom%253Aelsevier%253Aidp%253Apolicy%253Aproduct%253Ainst_assoc%26returnUrl%3D%252Fscience%252Farticle%252Fabs%252Fpii%252FS0370157320302477%26prompt%3Dnone%26cid%3Darp-bd516642-2638-4e37-bf5e-66821f94a540) in 2020.

My h-index is 26 according to [Inspire-HEP](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1269953), and my [Erdös number](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/collaborationDistance.html) is four.
