I am an Assistant Professor in physics at [Università degli Studi di Salerno](https://corsi.unisa.it/fisica/home) in Salerno since March 2025. Previously, I was a tenure-track Fellow at the [Tsung-Dao Lee Institute (TDLI)](https://tdli.sjtu.edu.cn/EN/) on 2021-2025, a ["Fellini" Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellow](https://web.infn.it/fellini/) at the [National Institute of Nuclear Physics (INFN)](http://w3.lnf.infn.it/?lang=en) in Italy, a Fellow at the [Gravitation, AstroParticle Physics Amsterdam (GRAPPA)](https://grappa.amsterdam), and a postdoc at [NORDITA](https://www.nordita.org) in Stockholm, Sweden. I graduated from The University of Utah in Salt Lake City, UT (USA).

My research activity spans various interesting topics including particle astrophysics, dark matter, dark energy, and black holes. I have focused on exploring the role the axion as a dark matter candidate, for which I co-wrote a [review on Physics Report](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0370157320302477?via%3Dihub) in 2020. I have collaborated on an impactful [paper on the Hubble tension](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6382/ac086d) in 2021.

I have been awarded a [Research Fund For International Scientists](https://www.nsfc.gov.cn/english/site_1/international/D5/2021/04-02/231.html) grant by the National Science Foundation of China in 2023, with the project titled "Astrophysical Axion Laboratories". In 2022, I have been the co-recipient of the prestigious [Buchalter Cosmology Prize](http://www.buchaltercosmologyprize.org) for "opening new, unforeseen vistas for the scientific scope of direct detection dark matter experiments".

My h-index is 46 according to [Inspire-HEP](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1269953), and my [Erdös number](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/collaborationDistance.html) is 4.
