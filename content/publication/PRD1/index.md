abstract: The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration has recently released the first image of a black hole (BH), opening a new window onto tests of general relativity in the strong field regime. In this paper, we derive constraints on the nature of M87* (the supermassive object at the center of the galaxy M87), exploiting the fact that its shadow appears to be highly circular, and using measurements of its angular size.
