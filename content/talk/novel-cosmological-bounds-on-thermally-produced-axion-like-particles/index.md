title: Novel Cosmological Bounds on Thermally-produced Axion-like Particles
abstract: We constrain the coupling of thermally-produced axion-like particles
  (here axions) with photons and gluons, using data from the cosmic microwave
  background (CMB) spectra and baryon acoustic oscillations. The axion possesses
  an explicit soft breaking mass term and it is produced thermally in the early
  Universe from either axion-photon or axion-gluon processes, accounting for the
  recent progresses in the field. We derive the most stringent bounds on the
  axion-gluon coupling to date on the mass range considered 10^(-4)eV < m_a <
  100eV, superseding the current bounds from SN1987A. The bounds on the
  axion-photon coupling are competitive with the results from the CAST
  collaboration for the axion mass > 3eV. We comment on the forecast reaches
  that will be available given the sensitivity of future CMB-S4 missions. Based
