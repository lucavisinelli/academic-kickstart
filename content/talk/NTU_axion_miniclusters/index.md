title: "Axion Miniclusters in the Milky Way"
abstract: Axion miniclusters (AMCs) are relatively dense, gravitationally bound clumps of Dark
Matter (DM) axions. AMCs have intriguing observational consequences for Earth-based axion
detectors, for DM substructure searches with microlensing, and for radio signatures from AMC
encounters with neutron stars (NSs). However, the properties of AMCs in the Milky Way may be
drastically altered by tidal interactions with ordinary stars. We present Monte Carlo simulations
following the evolution of AMCs orbiting in the Milky Way, which can be used to estimate
the properties of AMCs throughout the Galaxy today and can be easily recast. We use this
information as a key ingredient in estimating the rate, duration, flux and sky locations of radio
signals from axion-photon conversion due to NS encounters with AMCs. The resulting
radio transients are within reach of current and future radio telescopes, opening a new avenue for
detecting QCD axion DM.
