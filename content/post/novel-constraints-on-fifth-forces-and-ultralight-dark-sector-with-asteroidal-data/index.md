In [2107.04038](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.04038), my collaborators and myself have explored a novel idea: can high-quality asteroid data be used to constrain light bosons mediating a fifth force? This concept has been vastly covered by the lead author, Yu-Dai Tsai, in a Youtube interview available [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDX9XwLHBuM).

The preprint has been now published in JCAP (2023), with the updated version appearing on the arXiv preprint service. In the meantime, we are working on extending the collaboration to include asteroid data analysis experts and refine the search in future publications.
